# Note to Shelf
This code is a command-line tool for taking and managing notes from the terminal. Users are able to add, see the list, search for keywords, and clear notes. Each new note taken has a time stamp and date for better organization.

## Features
Add notes (with timestamps) that are stored in a separate text file. 

List all notes, showing them and their timestamps.

Search for notes using keywords (not case sensative).

Clear all notes from the text file.

Handles errors for invalid inputs or empty files.

Exit codes for both success and failure.
